    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fettuccine Alfredo or <strong>fettuccine al burro</strong> ("fettuccine with butter") is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed in butter and Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <p>As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta.</p>
    <p>The dish is named after Alfredo Di Lelio, who featured the dish at his restaurant in Rome in the early to mid-20th century; the "ceremony" of preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces fettuccine or other long pasta</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente. Drain, reserving 2 cups pasta cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Transfer 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to a large skillet. Bring to a gentle simmer, then whisk in butter, no more than 1 tablespoon at a time, until melted. Whisking constantly, gradually add cheese, making sure itâ€™s completely melted and incorporated before adding more. Add pasta and toss to coat, adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce blankets noodles completely. Serve topped with pepper and more cheese.</li>
    </ol>
